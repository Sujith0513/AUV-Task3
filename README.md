1) 1st question was pretty easy and gave me a bit of confidence to do the others
2) 2nd quest at first seemed very easy but when I started to get errors during the execution, I realized it isn't as easy as I thought at first
3) 3rd question was very tough at first but I solved it using if condition which I was asked not to use
4) Then I used custom messages to solve the task which was so interesting and I learnt so many things while having fun.
