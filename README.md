1) 1st question was pretty easy and gave me a bit of confidence to do the others.
2) 2nd quest at first seemed very easy but when I started to get errors during the execution, I realized it isn't as easy as I thought at first.
3) At first I subscribed after publishing so the first published message was not read or subscribed.
4) Later I asked the AUV member and I came to know that we should not subscribe inside the loop and we subscribe before we publish.
5) 3rd question was very tough at first but I solved it using if condition which I was asked not to use.
6) I learnt about the the function data._connection_header["callerid"] and get_name() function to use the if condition.
7) Then I used custom messages to solve the task which was so interesting and I learnt so many things while having fun.
8) The tasks are very well designed to learn about the various codes for publisher and subscriber in depth.
